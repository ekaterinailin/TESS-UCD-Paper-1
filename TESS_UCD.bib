	Abstract = {On 2014 December 9.61, the All-sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (ASAS-SN or ``Assassin'') discovered ASASSN-14lp just ˜2 days after first light using a global array of 14 cm diameter telescopes. ASASSN-14lp went on to become a bright supernova (V = 11.94 mag), second only to SN 2014J for the year. We present prediscovery photometry (with a detection less than a day after first light) and ultraviolet through near-infrared photometric and spectroscopic data covering the rise and fall of ASASSN-14lp for more than 100 days. We find that ASASSN-14lp had a broad light curve ({{Delta }}{m}15(B)=0.80+/- 0.05), a B-band maximum at 2457015.82 $\pm$ 0.03, a rise time of {16.94}-0.10+0.11 days, and moderate host-galaxy extinction (E{(B-V)}{host}=0.33+/- 0.06). Using ASASSN-14lp, we derive a distance modulus for NGC 4666 of mu =30.8+/- 0.2, corresponding to a distance of 14.7 $\pm$ 1.5 Mpc. However, adding ASASSN-14lp to the calibrating sample of Type Ia supernovae still requires an independent distance to the host galaxy. Finally, using our early-time photometric and spectroscopic observations, we rule out red giant secondaries and, assuming a favorable viewing angle and explosion time, any nondegenerate companion larger than 0.34 {R}&sun; .},

	Abstract = {2MASSW J0149090+295613 (hereafter 2M0149) is unique among the very late M/L dwarf counterparts to Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS) point sources in having shown, in the first set of spectra taken on 1997 December 7, a diverse emission-line spectrum at red wavelengths, which features an Halpha equivalent width of 300 {\AA}. On four repeat observations, however, the spectrum was that of a more ordinary dMe object, albeit with a late spectral type of M9.5 V. Our interpretation is that the object underwent an extreme magnetic flare event. The continuum flux at the short-wavelength end of the spectrum was also several times stronger during the apparent flare than in quiescence. Comparison is made with midtype M dwarfs of higher mass that have undergone strong flares, and with another known M9.5 emission-line object PC 0025+0047. The 2MASS object adds to the evidence that magnetic dynamo eruptions may release more energy relative to L_bol as the stellar mass decreases; if the total flare luminosity scales with Halpha in the same way as a well-observed event of the middle M dwarf AD Leo, 2M0149 may have had a flare luminosity that approached or exceeded its quiescent L_bol during the brief impulse phase. In contrast, its quiescent state shows an unremarkable level of chromospheric activity, which leads us to question whether it is unique at all; rather, it may be that many of the ultracool M and L dwarfs found by the Deep Near-Infrared Survey (DENIS) and 2MASS undergo similar flares.},

	Abstract = {Cool stars are known to produce flares probably as a result of the magnetic reconnection in their outer atmospheres. We present simultaneous XMM-Newton optical V band and X-ray observations of the M8 dwarf LP 412-31. During the observation a giant flare occurred, with an optical amplitude of 6 mag and total energy of 3 × 1032 erg in both the V band and soft X-rays. Both flare onset and flare decay were completely covered in both wavebands with a temporal resolution of 20 s, allowing determination of the flare time scales, as well as a study of the temperature evolution of the flaring plasma. The data are consistent with an impulsive energy release followed by radiative cooling without any further energy release during the decay phase. Our analysis suggests that the optical flare originates from a small fraction of the surface of LP 412-31, while the characteristic scale size of the flaring X-ray plasma is of the order of the stellar radius or larger. The absence of any small-scale variability in the light curve suggests a non-standard flare number energy distribution.},

	Abstract = {We present simultaneous UV, G, R and I monitoring of 19 M dwarfs that reveal a huge flare on the M9 dwarf with an amplitude in the UV of at least 6 mag. This is one of the strongest detections ever of an optical flare in an M star and one of the first in an ultracool dwarf (spectral types later than about M7). Four intermediate-strength flares (DeltamUV < 4mag) were found in this and three other targets. For the whole sample we deduce a flare probability of 0.013 (rate of 0.022h-1), and 0.049 (0.090h-1) for 2M1707+64 alone. Deviations of the flare emission from a blackbody is consistent with strong Halpha line emission. We also confirm our previously found rotation period for 2M1707+64 and determine it more precisely to be 3.619 +/- 0.015h.},

@phdthesis{Hilton2011phd,
	Abstract = {Flares are magnetic reconnection events in the atmospheres of cool stars that lead to a myriad of observed emission, including broadband optical flux increases that can be more than 100 times the quiescent flux of the star. We have obtained nearly 1000 hours of photometric monitoring of 39 dwarf stars, both magnetically active and inactive, with spectral types from M0 to M8, to measure their flare frequency distributions (FFDs - the frequency of flares of various energies). The quantitative algorithm we developed for flare identification makes no assumptions about flare shapes and uses the noise characteristics of the light curves to determine the minimum flare energy that can be detected. We identify 239 flares, from which we present the first FFD measurements for both inactive and active early-type stars; inactive, mid-type stars; and active, late-type stars. We also measure FFDs for active, mid-type M dwarfs that compare well with previous studies. A subset of 137 flares were determined to be classical type flares, which we use to investigate the rise times, peak magnitudes, decay times, and total energies. We adopt an analytic flare shape model, and then use the measured FFDs and measured distributions of rise and decay times to construct simulated light curves appropriate for stars with specified spectral types and magnetic activity levels. We use the Galactic stellar population model Galfast to generate volume-limited catalogs of stars in the Milky Way. By constructing light curves with the appropriate FFDs for each star in the catalog, we can model the flare rates for time-domain photometric surveys. The Galactic flare rate model was compared to flares identified in the Sloan Digital Sky Survey Stripe 82, allowing us to calibrate the model parameters. When applied to the survey characteristics of the Large Synoptic Survey Telescope (LSST), the model predicts that there will be several flares with u-band enhancements of more than 0.1 magnitudes in every 9.6 deg² full-frame exposure at low Galactic latitudes. The model further predicts that M dwarf flaring will cause ˜1% of LSST u-band images to contain an optical transient - a large flare on an M dwarf that is too faint to be seen in any filter during quiescence.},

	Abstract = {We present the activity and kinematics of a representative volume-limited (20 pc) sample of 152 late-M and L dwarfs (M7-L8) photometrically selected from the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). Using new proper-motion measurements and spectrophotometric distance estimates, we calculate tangential velocities. The sample has a mean tangential velocity of <Vtan>=31.5 km s-1, a velocity dispersion of sigmatan=20.7 km s-1, and a maximum tangential velocity of Vtan=138.8 km s-1. These kinematic results are in excellent agreement with previous studies of ultracool dwarfs in the local solar neighborhood. Halpha emission, an indicator of chromospheric activity, was detected in 63 of 81 late-M dwarfs and in 16 of 69 L dwarfs examined. We find a lack of correlation between activity strength, measured by log(FHalpha/Fbol), and Vtan, although velocity distributions suggest that the active dwarfs in our sample are slightly younger than the inactive dwarfs. Consistent with previous studies of activity in ultracool dwarfs, we find that the fraction of Halpha-emitting objects per spectral type peaks at spectral type M7 and declines through mid-L dwarfs. Activity strength is similarly correlated with spectral type for types later than M7. Eleven dwarfs out of 150 show evidence of variability, ranging from small fluctuations to large flare events. We estimate a flare cycle of ~5% for late-M dwarfs and ~2% for L dwarfs. Observations of strong, variable activity on the L1 dwarf 2MASS J10224821+5825453 and an amazing flare event on the M7 dwarf 2MASS J1028404-143843 are discussed.},

	Abstract = {The object 2MASSI J1315309-264951 is an L3 dwarf with strong Halpha emission discovered in the course of a color-selected survey for active galactic nuclei using the Two Micron All Sky Survey (2MASS). The strength of its Halpha emission decreased by about a factor of 2 between two epochs separated by 137 days. This is the first time that variable Halpha emission has been reported in an L dwarf, and it is probably the first observation of an Halpha flare in an L dwarf. The value of log(LHalpha/Lbol)>-4.17 observed at the discovery epoch is larger than that of any other L dwarf, but it is comparable to that of 2MASSI J1237392+652615, the only reported T dwarf with Halpha emission. The observed variability indicates that the Halpha emission of 2MASSI J1315309-264951 is powered either by magnetic fields or by accretion in a binary system. Spectroscopic or narrowband Halpha monitoring of L and T dwarfs on timescales of hours to days would be the most useful step toward a better understanding of their Halpha emission mechanism(s).},

	Abstract = {Rotation is a directly observable stellar property, and it drives magnetic field generation and activity through a magnetic dynamo. Main-sequence stars with masses below approximately 0.35 {M}&sun;  (mid-to-late M dwarfs) are fully convective, and are expected to have a different type of dynamo mechanism than solar-type stars. Measurements of their rotation rates provide insight into these mechanisms, but few rotation periods are available for these stars at field ages. Using photometry from the MEarth Project, we measure rotation periods for 387 nearby, mid-to-late M dwarfs in the northern hemisphere, finding periods from 0.1 to 140 days. The typical rotator has stable, sinusoidal photometric modulations at a semi-amplitude of 0.5%-1%. We find no period-amplitude relation for stars below 0.25 {M}&sun;  and an anticorrelation between period and amplitude for higher-mass M dwarfs. We highlight the existence of older, slowly rotating stars without Halpha emission that nevertheless have strong photometric variability. We use parallaxes, proper motions, radial velocities, photometry, and near-infrared metallicity estimates to further characterize the population of rotators. The Galactic kinematics of our sample is consistent with the local population of G and K dwarfs, and rotators have metallicities characteristic of the solar neighborhood. We use the W space velocities and established age-velocity relations to estimate that stars with P < 10 days have ages of on average <2 Gyr, and that those with P > 70 days have ages of about 5 Gyr. The period distribution is dependent on mass: as the mass decreases, the slowest rotators at a given mass have longer periods, and the fastest rotators have shorter periods. We find a lack of stars with intermediate rotation periods, and the gap between the fast and slow rotators is larger for lower masses. Our data are consistent with a scenario in which these stars maintain rapid rotation for several gigayears, then spin down quickly, reaching periods of around 100 days by a typical age of 5 Gyr.},

	Abstract = {We present a spectroscopic analysis of over 38,000 low-mass stars from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) Data Release 5 (DR5). Analysis of this unprecedentedly large sample confirms the previously detected decrease in the fraction of magnetically active stars (as traced by Halpha emission) as a function of the vertical distance from the Galactic plane. The magnitude and slope of this effect vary as a function of spectral type. Using simple 1D dynamical models, we demonstrate that the drop in activity fraction can be explained by thin-disk dynamical heating and a rapid decrease in magnetic activity. The timescale for this rapid activity decrease changes according to the spectral type. By comparing our data to the simulations, we calibrate the age-activity relation at each M dwarf spectral type. We also present evidence for a possible decrease in the metallicity as a function of height above the Galactic plane. In addition to our activity analysis, we provide line measurements, molecular band indices, colors, radial velocities, 3D space motions, and mean properties as a function of spectral type for the SDSS DR5 low-mass star sample.},

	Abstract = {A fraction of very low mass stars and brown dwarfs are known to be radio active, in some cases producing periodic pulses. Extensive studies of two such objects have also revealed optical periodic variability, and the nature of this variability remains unclear. Here, we report on multi-epoch optical photometric monitoring of six radio-detected dwarfs, spanning the ~M8-L3.5 spectral range, conducted to investigate the ubiquity of periodic optical variability in radio-detected ultracool dwarfs. This survey is the most sensitive ground-based study carried out to date in search of periodic optical variability from late-type dwarfs, where we obtained 250 hr of monitoring, delivering photometric precision as low as ~0.15%. Five of the six targets exhibit clear periodicity, in all cases likely associated with the rotation period of the dwarf, with a marginal detection found for the sixth. Our data points to a likely association between radio and optical periodic variability in late-M/early-L dwarfs, although the underlying physical cause of this correlation remains unclear. In one case, we have multiple epochs of monitoring of the archetype of pulsing radio dwarfs, the M9 TVLM 513--46546, spanning a period of 5 yr, which is sufficiently stable in phase to allow us to establish a period of 1.95958 $\pm$ 0.00005 hr. This phase stability may be associated with a large-scale stable magnetic field, further strengthening the correlation between radio activity and periodic optical variability. Finally, we find a tentative spin-orbit alignment of one component of the very low mass binary, LP 349--25.},

	Abstract = {In a volume-limited sample of 63 ultracool dwarfs of spectral type M7-M9.5, we have obtained high-resolution spectroscopy with UVES at the Very Large Telescope and HIRES at Keck Observatory. In this second paper, we present projected rotation velocities, average magnetic field strengths, and chromospheric emission from the Halpha line. We confirm earlier results that the mean level of normalized Halpha luminosity decreases with lower temperature, and we find that the scatter among Halpha luminosities is larger at lower temperature. We measure average magnetic fields between 0 and 4 kG with no indication for a dependence on temperature between M7 and M9.5. For a given temperature, Halpha luminosity is related to magnetic field strength, consistent with results in earlier stars. A few very slowly rotating stars show very weak magnetic fields and Halpha emission, and all stars rotating faster than our detection limit show magnetic fields of at least a few hundred Gauss. In contrast to earlier-type stars, we observe magnetic fields weaker than 1 kG in stars rotating faster than ~3 km s-1, but we find no correlation between rotation and magnetic flux generation among them. We interpret this as a fundamental change in the dynamo mechanism; in ultracool dwarfs, magnetic field generation is predominantly achieved by a turbulent dynamo, while other mechanisms can operate more efficiently at earlier spectral types.},

	Abstract = {We present the colors and activity of ultracool (M7--L8) dwarfs from the Tenth Data Release of the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS). We combine previous samples of SDSS M and L dwarfs with new data obtained from the Baryon Oscillation Sky Survey (BOSS) to produce the BOSS Ultracool Dwarf (BUD) sample of 11820 M7--L8 dwarfs. By combining SDSS data with photometry from 2MASS and the Wide-field Infrared Sky Explorer (WISE) mission, we present ultracool dwarf colors from i-z to W2-W3 as a function of spectral type, and extend the SDSS--2MASS--WISE color locus to include ultracool dwarfs. The i-z, i-J, and z-J colors provide the best indication of spectral type for M7--L3 dwarfs. We also examine ultracool dwarf chromospheric activity through the presence and strength of Hα emission. The fraction of active dwarfs rises through the M spectral sequence until it reaches ∼90% at spectral type L0. The fraction of active dwarfs then declines to 50% at spectral type L5; no Hα emission is observed in the late-L dwarfs in the BUD sample. The fraction of active L0--L5 dwarfs is much higher than previously observed. The strength of activity declines with spectral type from M7 through L3, after which the data do not show a clear trend. Using one-dimensional chromosphere models, we explore the range of filling factors and chromospheric temperature structures that are consistent with Hα observations of M0--L7 dwarfs. M dwarf chromospheres have a similar, smoothly varying range of temperature and surface coverage, while L dwarf chromospheres are cooler and have smaller filling factors.},

	Abstract = {We present the second Gaia data release, Gaia DR2, consisting of astrometry, photometry, radial velocities, and information on astrophysical parameters and variability, for sources brighter than magnitude 21. In addition epoch astrometry and photometry are provided for a modest sample of minor planets in the solar system. A summary of the contents of Gaia DR2 is presented, accompanied by a discussion on the differences with respect to Gaia DR1 and an overview of the main limitations which are still present in the survey. Recommendations are made on the responsible use of Gaia DR2 results. Gaia DR2 contains celestial positions and the apparent brightness in G for approximately 1.7 billion sources. For 1.3 billion of those sources, parallaxes and proper motions are in addition available. The sample of sources for which variability information is provided is expanded to 0.5 million stars. This data release contains four new elements: broad-band colour information in the form of the apparent brightness in the $G_\mathrm{BP}$ (330--680 nm) and $G_\mathrm{RP}$ (630--1050 nm) bands is available for 1.4 billion sources; median radial velocities for some 7 million sources are presented; for between 77 and 161 million sources estimates are provided of the stellar effective temperature, extinction, reddening, and radius and luminosity; and for a pre-selected list of 14000 minor planets in the solar system epoch astrometry and photometry are presented. Finally, Gaia DR2 also represents a new materialisation of the celestial reference frame in the optical, the Gaia-CRF2, which is the first optical reference frame based solely on extragalactic sources. There are notable changes in the photometric system and the catalogue source list with respect to Gaia DR1, and we stress the need to consider the two data releases as independent.},

	Abstract = {We present optical template spectra, bolometric corrections, and χ values for ultracool dwarfs. The templates are based on spectra from the Sloan Digital Sky Survey (SDSS) and the Astrophysical Research Consortium 3.5 m telescope. The spectral features and overall shape of the L dwarf templates are consistent with previous spectroscopic standards and the templates have a radial velocity precision of ˜10-20 km s-1. We calculate bolometric fluxes (accurate to 10-20%) for 101 late-M and L dwarfs from SDSS, 2MASS, and WISE photometry, SDSS spectra, and BT-Settl model spectra. We find that the z-band and J-band bolometric corrections for late-M and L dwarfs have a strong correlation with z-J and J-KScolors, respectively. The new χ values, which can be used to convert Hα equivalent widths to activity strength, are based on spectrophotometrically calibrated SDSS spectra and the new bolometric fluxes. While the measured χ values have typical uncertainties of ˜20%, ultracool dwarf models show the continuum surrounding Hα can vary by up to an order of magnitude with changing surface gravity. Our semiempirical χ values are one to two orders of magnitude larger than previous χ values for mid-to-late L dwarfs, indicating that the upper limits for Hα activity strength on the coolest L dwarfs have been underestimated.},

	Abstract = {The high-energy emission from low-mass stars is mediated by the magnetic dynamo. Although the mechanisms by which fully convective stars generate large-scale magnetic fields are not well understood, it is clear that, as for solar-type stars, stellar rotation plays a pivotal role. We present 270 new optical spectra of low-mass stars in the Solar Neighborhood. Combining our observations with those from the literature, our sample comprises 2202 measurements or non-detections of Halpha emission in nearby M dwarfs. This includes 466 with photometric rotation periods. Stars with masses between 0.1 and 0.6 M &sun; are well-represented in our sample, with fast and slow rotators of all masses. We observe a threshold in the mass--period plane that separates active and inactive M dwarfs. The threshold coincides with the fast-period edge of the slowly rotating population, at approximately the rotation period at which an era of rapid rotational evolution appears to cease. The well-defined active/inactive boundary indicates that Halpha activity is a useful diagnostic for stellar rotation period, e.g., for target selection for exoplanet surveys, and we present a mass-period relation for inactive M dwarfs. We also find a significant, moderate correlation between L Halpha /L bol and variability amplitude: more active stars display higher levels of photometric variability. Consistent with previous work, our data show that rapid rotators maintain a saturated value of L Halpha /L bol. Our data also show a clear power-law decay in L Halpha /L bol with Rossby number for slow rotators, with an index of -1.7 $\pm$ 0.1.},

	Abstract = {We use Kepler K2 Campaign 4 short-cadence photometry to measure white light flares in the young, moving group brown dwarfs 2MASS J03350208+2342356 (2M0335+23) and 2MASS J03552337+1133437 (2M0355+11), and report on long-cadence photometry of a flare in the Pleiades M8 brown dwarf CFHT-PL-17. We also report a new measurement of the radial velocity of 2M0335+23 which confirms that this M7 brown dwarf is a beta Pic Moving Group member. We identify a long-lived starspot, and find that the rotation period (5.24 hr) and projected rotational velocity (45 km/s) confirm 2M0335+23 is inflated ($R \ge 0.20 R_\odot$) as predicted. We detect 22 white light flares on 2M0335+23. The flare frequency distribution follows a power-law distribution with slope $-\alpha = -1.7$ over the range $10^{31}$ to $10^{33}$ erg. This slope is similar to that observed in the Sun and warmer flare stars, and with lower energy flares in previous ground-based work on M6-M8 field very-low-mass stars; taken the two datasets together, the flare frequency distribution for young brown dwarfs is a power law over 4.3 orders of magnitude. Even more energetic flares are possible on warm brown dwarfs, as demonstrated by the superflare on the 130-Myr old CFHT-PL-17, which we estimate had an energy of $2.6\times10^{34}$ erg. In contrast, we detect no white light flares down to an energy limit of $2\times10^{30}$ erg in the nearby L$5\gamma$ brown dwarf 2M0355+11, a member of the 150-Myr old AB Dor Moving Group. This is consistent with the view that fast magnetic reconnection is suppressed in cool atmospheres. We discuss two complex, multi-peaked flares observed in 2M0335+23 and compare them to complex flares observed on warmer stars. We argue that these complex flares can be understood as sympathetic flares, in which fast-mode MHD waves similar to EUV waves in the Sun trigger magnetic reconnection in different active regions.},

	Abstract = {We report on K2 Campaign 8 measurements of a huge white light flare on the L1 dwarf SDSSp J005406.55-003101.8 (EPIC 220186653). The source is a typical L1 dwarf at a distance of ˜50 pc, probably an old hydrogen-burning star rather than a young brown dwarf. In the long (30-minute) cadence photometry, the flare peak is 21 times the flux of the stellar photosphere in the broad optical Kepler filter, which we estimate corresponds to DeltaV ≈ -7.1. The total equivalent duration of the flare is 15.4 hr. We estimate that the total bolometric energy of the flare was 4 × 1033 erg, more powerful than the previously reported Kepler white light flares for the L1 dwarf WISEP J190648.47+401106.8, but weaker than the DeltaV = -11 L0 dwarf superflare ASASSN-16ae. The initial (impulsive) cooling phase is too rapid to resolve with our 30-minute cadence data, but after 1 hour the gradual cooling phase has an exponential time constant of 1.8 hr. We use template fitting to estimate that the full time-width-at-half-amplitude of the light curve is <10 minutes and that the true flare maximum reached ˜70 times the stellar photosphere, or DeltaV ≈ -8. This flare is comparable to the most powerful Kepler flares observed on the active M4 dwarf GJ 1243.},

	Abstract = {We report on the results of 15 months of monitoring the nearby field L1 dwarf WISEP J190648.47+401106.8 (W1906+40) with the Kepler mission. Supporting observations with the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array and Gemini North Telescope reveal that the L dwarf is magnetically active, with quiescent radio and variable Hα emission. A preliminary trigonometric parallax shows that W1906+40 is at a distance of 16.35^{+0.36}_{-0.34} pc, and all observations are consistent with W1906+40 being an old disk star just above the hydrogen-burning limit. The star shows photometric variability with a period of 8.9 hr and an amplitude of 1.5%, with a consistent phase throughout the year. We infer a radius of 0.92 $\pm$ 0.07RJ and sin i > 0.57 from the observed period, luminosity (10--3.67 $\pm$ 0.03 L ☉), effective temperature (2300 $\pm$ 75 K), and vsin i (11.2 $\pm$ 2.2 km s--1). The light curve may be modeled with a single large, high latitude dark spot. Unlike many L-type brown dwarfs, there is no evidence of other variations at the >~ 2% level, either non-periodic or transient periodic, that mask the underlying rotation period. We suggest that the long-lived surface features may be due to starspots, but the possibility of cloud variations cannot be ruled out without further multi-wavelength observations. During the Gemini spectroscopy, we observed the most powerful flare ever seen on an L dwarf, with an estimated energy of ~1.6 × 1032 erg in white light emission. Using the Kepler data, we identify similar flares and estimate that white light flares with optical/ultraviolet energies of 1031 erg or more occur on W1906+40 as often as 1-2 times per month.},

	Abstract = {Using a recent census of flare stars from the Kepler survey, we have explored how flare activity evolves across stellar main sequence lifetimes. We utilize a sample of 347 stars with robust flare activity detections, and which have rotation periods measured via starspot modulations in their Kepler light curves. We consider three separate methods for quantifying flare activity from optical light curves, and compare their utility for comparing flare activity between stars of differing ages and luminosities. These metrics include: the fractional luminosity emitted in flares, the specific rate of flares emitted at a given energy, and a model for the entire flare frequency distribution. With all three approaches we find that flare activity decreases for all low-mass stars as they spin-down, and thus with age. Most striking is the evolution of the flare occurrence frequency distributions, which show no significant change in the power law slope with age. Since our sample is preferentially constructed of younger, more active stars, our model over-predicts the super-flare rate previously estimated for the Sun. Finally, we parameterize our best-fit model of the flare frequency distribution for ease in predicting the rates of flares and their associated impacts on planet habitability and detection.},

Optical and infrared spectroscopy indicate a spectral type of L0 with strong Hα emission and a blue NIR spectral slope. Combining the photometric distance, proper motion, and radial velocity of SDSS0533 yields three-dimensional velocities of (U, V, W) = (14 $\pm$ 13, -35 $\pm$ 14, -94 $\pm$ 22) km s-1, indicating that it is most likely part of the thick disk population and probably old. The three detections of SDSS0533 obtained during the flare are consistent with a total V-band flare energy of at least 4.9 × 1033 erg (corresponding to a total thermal energy of at least E tot 〉 3.7 × 1034 erg), placing it among the strongest detected M dwarf flares. The presence of this powerful flare on an old L0 dwarf may indicate that stellar-type magnetic activity persists down to the end of the main sequence and on older ML transition dwarfs.},

	Abstract = {We analyze a ΔV ~ -9 magnitude flare on the newly identified M8 dwarf SDSS J022116.84+194020.4 (hereafter SDSSJ0221) detected as part of the All-Sky Automated Survey for Supernovae. Using infrared and optical spectra, we confirm that SDSSJ0221 is a relatively nearby (d ~ 76 pc) M8 dwarf with strong quiescent Hα emission. Based on kinematics and the absence of features consistent with low-gravity (young) ultracool dwarfs, we place a lower limit of 200 Myr on the age of SDSSJ0221. When modeled with a simple, classical flare light curve, this flare is consistent with a total U-band flare energy EU ~ 1034 erg, confirming that the most dramatic flares are not limited to warmer, more massive stars. Scaled to include a rough estimate of the emission line contribution to the V band, we estimate a blackbody filling factor of ~10%-30% during the flare peak and ~0.5%-1.6% during the flare decay phase. These filling factors correspond to flare areas that are an order of magnitude larger than those measured for most mid-M dwarf flares.
